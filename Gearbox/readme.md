In short, the Cosmo gearbox has an additional Lockup solenoid (which is on-off), which feeds the main PWM controlled solenoid.

That link also contains desired line pressures, which is useful for when building a custom transmission controller.

Our gearboxes have a port on the side of the gearbox which is designed for a diagnostic pressure sensor for testing. We can use this to add a line pressure sensor!
