From Section U, page 18 of the Workshop manual (see WSM section of this wiki)

1. Warm up engine
2. with engine running, use a 100w lamp, 8cm from sunlight sensor on dash:

3. Switch off ignition
4. Turn ignition switch on, while holding down the AUTO and Defrost switches at same time, and wait 10 seconds

During this 10 seconds you will hear the system self test blend doors etc

After 10 seconds a code will be produced - the codes are as below:

00 No Error

02 Sun Light Sensor

06 Head Area Inside Air Sensor

08 Foot Area Inside Air Sensor

10 Duct Sensor 

12 Outside Air Sensor

14 Water Temperature Sensor 

18 Potentiometer (Mix Actuator)

21 Potentiometer (Mode Actuator)

27 Potentiometer (Cold Air Bypass Actuator)

30 Potentiometer (Left/Right Air Distribution Actuator)

46 Air Conditioner Relay Signal - Relay or Pressure Switch or AC Amplifier

49 Max HI Relay Signal - AC Amplifier

50 OFF Relay Signal - OFF Relay or AC Amplifier

52 Mix Actuator

53 Mode Actuator

54 Intake Actuator

55 Cold Air Bypass Actuator

56 Left/Right Air Distribution Actuator

**Other diagnosis:**

Hold down Recirc and fresh air switch while turning ignition from ACC to on.

This will show codes :

00 = no error

29 or 30 = L/R distributuion switch failure

32 or 33 = Head Area temperature switch

Any code with 5x or 6x = audio control signalling/head unit issues
